A toolkit featured _**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence Ã— **a**b **i**nitio_ for computational chemistry research.

*Please be advised that `ai2-kit` is still under heavy development and you should expect things to change often. We encourage people to play and explore with `ai2-kit`, and stay tuned with us for more features to come.*


## Feature Highlights
* Collection of tools to facilitate the development of automated workflows for computational chemistry research.
* Use with [oh-my-batch](https://github.com/link89/oh-my-batch) to build your own workflow with shell script.


## Installation

You can use the following command to install `ai2-kit`:

```bash
# for users who just use most common features
pip install ai2-kit

# for users who want to use all features
pip install ai2-kit[all]
```

If you want to run `ai2-kit` from source, you can run the following commands in the project folder:

```bash
pip install poetry
# If you meet ConnectionError, you can try to set the max-workers to a smaller number, e.g
# poetry config installer.max-workers 4
poetry install
poetry run ai2-kit
```
