# CLL Machine Learning Potential Training Workflow

```bash
ai2-kit workflow cll-mlp-training
```

## Introduction

CLL workflow is an improved version of DPGEN workflow, which is designed to meet more complex potential training requirements and sustainable code integration. CLL workflow adopts a closed-loop learning mode to automatically train MLP potential. In each iteration, the workflow uses labeled structures generated by first-principles methods to train multiple MLP models. Then, these models are used to explore new structures as training data for the next iteration. The iteration will continue until the quality of the MLP model meets the predetermined standard. The configuration of each iteration can be updated according to the training needs to further improve the training efficiency.

The main improvements of CLL workflow include:
* More semantic configuration system to support the selection of different software, and set different software configurations according to different systems.
* More robust checkpoint mechanism to reduce the impact of execution interruption.
* Support remote Python method execution to avoid unnecessary data transfer and improve the efficiency and stability of execution on HPC clusters.

Currently, CLL workflow supports the following tools for potential training:
* Label: CP2K, VASP
* Train: DeepMD
* Explore: LAMMPS, LASP
* Select: Model deviation, Distinctive structure selection

Currently, CLL workflow submits jobs through the HPC executor provided by `ai2-kit`, which supports completing calculations in a single HPC cluster. In the future, multi-cluster scheduling and support for different workflow engines including `DFlow` will be considered according to needs.

## Environment Requirements
* The Python version of the workflow execution environment and the HPC execution environment need to be consistent, otherwise there will be problems with remote execution.
* The HPC execution environment needs to install `ai2-kit`. Generally speaking, the `ai2-kit` on the HPC does not need to be strictly the same as the local `ai2-kit` version, but if the difference is too large, there may still be problems, so it is recommended to use the same version of `ai2-kit` when conditions permit.


## Installation

```bash
pip install -U ai2-kit
```

## Usage

The usage of CLL workflow is demonstrated through an example.

### Data Preparation
The data required for the execution of the workflow needs to be placed on the HPC cluster node in advance. Before starting the execution of the workflow, you need to prepare the following data:
* Initial structure or initial data set for potential training
* Initial structure for structure search

Assuming that you already have a trajectory generated by AIMD `h2o_64.aimd.xyz`, then you can use the [`ai2-kit tool ase`](./ase.md) command line tool to prepare these data.

```bash
mkdir -p data/explore

# Extract training set from 0-900 frames, extract every 5 frames
ai2-kit tool ase read h2o_64.aimd.xyz --index ':900:5' - set_cell "[12.42,12.42,12.42,90,90,90]" - write data/training.xyz

# Extract validation set from 900- frames, extract every 5 frames
ai2-kit tool ase read h2o_64.aimd.xyz --index '900::5' - set_cell "[12.42,12.42,12.42,90,90,90]" - write data/validation.xyz

# Extract data for initial structure search, extract every 100 frames
ai2-kit tool ase read h2o_64.aimd.xyz --index '::100' - set_cell "[12.42,12.42,12.42,90,90,90]" - write_each_frame "./data/explore/POSCAR-{i:04d}" --format vasp
```

### Configuration File Preparation

The configuration file of CLL workflow is in YAML format and supports splitting in any dimension. `ai2-kit` will automatically merge them during execution. Moderate splitting is conducive to the maintenance and reuse of configuration files. In general, we can split the configuration file into the following parts:

* artifact.yml: the data required by the workflow
* executor.yml: the parameters of the HPC executor
* workflow.yml: the parameters of the workflow software

Another way to build configuration is to use the configuration file provided in [example](../../example/config/cll-mlp-training/) as a reference to create your own workflow. For details, please refer to the document in the example directory.

We start with `artifact.yml`, which is used to configure the data required by the workflow. In this example, we need to configure three datasets, which are the training dataset, the validation dataset, and the dataset for structure search. The configuration of these three datasets is as follows:


```yaml
.base_dir: &base_dir /home/user01/data/

artifacts:
  h2o_64-train:
    url: !join [*base_dir, training.xyz]
    
  h2o_64-validation:
    url: !join [*base_dir, validation.xyz]
    attrs:
      deepmd:
        validation_data: true  # Specify this dataset as the validation set, Optional

  h2o_64-explore:
    url: !join [*base_dir, explore]
    includes: POSCAR*
    attrs:  
    # If necessary, you can specify specific software configurations for specific systems here. This example does not require this configuration, so it is empty
      # lammps:
      #   plumed_config:  !load_text plumed.in
      # cp2k:
      #   input_template: !load_text cp2k.inp
```

Here we use the custom tag `!join` provided by `ai2-kit` to simplify the data configuration. For related functions, please refer to the [TIPS](./tips.md) document.

Next, we configure the `executor.yml` file, which is used to configure parameters related to the HPC link and the use template of the software.

```yaml
executors:
  hpc-cluster01:
    ssh:
      host: user01@login-01  # Login node
      gateway:
        host: user01@jump-host  # Jump host (optional)
    queue_system:
      slurm: {}  # Use slurm as the job scheduling system

    work_dir: /home/user01/ai2-kit/workdir  # Working directory
    python_cmd: /home/user01/libs/conda/env/py39/bin/python  # Remote Python interpreter

Finally, the configuration of the `workflow.yml` file is the configuration of the parameters of the workflow. This file is used to configure the parameters of the workflow.

```

### Execute Workflow

After completing the configuration, you can start the execution of the workflow

```bash
ai2-kit workflow cll-mlp-training *.yml --executor hpc-cluster01 --path-prefix h2o_64-run-01 --checkpoint run-01.ckpt
```

In the above parameters,
* `*.yml` is used to specify the configuration file, you can specify multiple configuration files, `ai2-kit` will automatically merge them, `*` wildcard is used here;
* `--executor hpc-cluster01` is used to specify the HPC executor to use. Here, the `hpc-cluster01` executor configured in the previous section is used;
* `--path-prefix h2o_64-run-01` specifies the remote working directory, which will create a `h2o_64-run-01` directory under `work_dir` to store the execution results of the workflow;
* `--checkpoint run-01.cpkt` will generate a checkpoint file locally to save the execution status of the workflow, so as to resume execution after the execution is interrupted.

## Special Use Cases

### Train MLP model for FEP based Redox Potential Calculation

To train MLP model for FEP based Redox Potential Calculation,
you need to make use of `fparam` feature of `deepmd`
to fit the PES of initial (ini) and finial (fin) state of the reaction.

And should also config different label configuration for ini and fin state.

Here is the key configuration you need to pay attention to:

#### Config explore artifacts with `fep-ini` and `fep-fin` attrs

Explore artifacts are used as initial structures for structure explore.  For example:

```yaml
artifacts:
  explore-h2ox64:
    url: /path/to/h2ox64.xyz
    attrs:
      fep-ini:
        dp_fparam: 0
        cp2k:
          input_template: !load_text cp2k-ini.inp
      fep-fin:
        dp_fparam: 1
        cp2k:
          input_template: !load_text cp2k-fin.inp
```

#### Config LAMMPS explore mode with `fep-redox`
The following example dismiss the common configuration of LAMMPS,
and only focus on the `fep-redox` specific configuration.

```yaml
workflow:
  explore:
    lammps:
      mode: fep-redox
      template_vars:
        # The fparam option of deepmd pair style
        # The value of fparam should be consistent with the fparam in the explore artifacts
        # doc: https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/latest/third-party/lammps-command.html#pair-style-deepmd
        FEP_INI_DP_OPT: fparam 0
        FEP_FIN_DP_OPT: fparam 1
```

#### Config `numb_fparam` in `deepmd` input template
https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/train/train-input.html
